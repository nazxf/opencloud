This file stays **concise and authoritative**. Depth lives in the linked docs —

## 1. What this project is

OpenCloud is a custom **cloud shared-hosting platform** (a Hostinger/cPanel
alternative) with a bespoke dashboard and a Go control plane, driving **Hestia
Control Panel** as a provisioning backend. The Go backend is the system of
record; Hestia is never exposed to customers.

## 4. Architecture in one screen

```
Customer/Admin → Next.js dashboard → Go/Gin API (/api/v1, JWT)
                                       ├─ PostgreSQL (Bun)   system of record · job queue
                                       ├─ Redis              cache · sessions · rate limits
                                       └─ Provisioner ──→ Hestia node
                                                            (Nginx · Apache · PHP-FPM ·
                                                             MariaDB · BIND9 · Certbot)
```

**Backend layering — never skip a layer:**
```
handler (Gin) → service (logic, transactions) → repository (Bun) → PostgreSQL
                       └→ provisioner (only Hestia caller) → hosting node
```

- Handlers translate HTTP ↔ domain; **no business logic, no DB access**.
- Services own business rules and transactions; the only layer spanning repos/provisioner.
- Repositories own all DB access; **every customer query is scoped by `account_id`**.
- The provisioner is the **only** thing that talks to a hosting node, and it is idempotent.
- Work that can exceed ~1s is **enqueued as a `jobs` row** (same transaction as the
  write that triggered it) and handled by the worker, not run inline.

## 5. AI Coding Rules (apply every time)

1. **Read before writing.** Match existing patterns in the touched area. This file
   and the linked docs override defaults; when silent, follow the surrounding code.
2. **Stay in the lines** — respect layering, naming, and folder structure.
3. **Smallest correct change.** Shortest diff that fully solves the task. No
   unrequested abstractions, files, or dependencies.
4. **No new dependency** without justification that stdlib / an installed package
   can't do it — and confirmation.
5. **Don't invent contracts.** If an endpoint, schema, or type isn't defined,
   propose or ask — don't fabricate an API shape silently.
6. **Security and tenant-scoping are never simplified away.** Validate input at
   boundaries; scope every customer query by `account_id`.
7. **Non-trivial logic ships with a test** (a branch, loop, parser, money/auth path).
8. **Explain briefly, in proportion to the change.** Code first; note what you
   skipped and when to add it. No essays.
9. **Surface, don't paper over.** If a request conflicts with these docs, a
   migration looks destructive, or a fix hides a real bug — say so first.
10. **Keep docs true.** Change architecture/conventions/stack → update the relevant
    doc in the same PR, and add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry.

## 6. Things to never do

- ❌ Business logic in handlers or React components.
- ❌ DB access outside repositories; SQL built by string concatenation.
- ❌ Querying customer data without an `account_id` scope.
- ❌ Talking to a hosting node from anywhere but the provisioner.
- ❌ Tokens in `localStorage`; logging secrets; committing `.env`.
- ❌ `any` in TypeScript; `interface{}` as a lazy escape hatch in Go.
- ❌ Floats for money; non-UTC timestamps; magic numbers.
- ❌ Editing a shipped migration instead of adding a new one.
- ❌ Long-running work synchronously inside an HTTP handler.
- ❌ A second component/styling library alongside shadcn/ui + Tailwind.
- ❌ Leaking stack traces, SQL, or Hestia output to API clients.
- ❌ Committing/pushing without the human's go-ahead; committing straight to `main`.

## 7. Quick command reference

```bash
# Backend (backend/)
go run ./cmd/api          # API server
go run ./cmd/worker       # job worker
go run ./cmd/migrate up   # migrations
go test ./...             # tests
golangci-lint run         # lint

# Frontend (repo root)
npm run dev               # dev server
npm run lint              # oxlint
npm run build             # production build

# Stack
docker compose up --build
```
