# Hosting Stack — Hestia & the Data Plane

OpenCloud orchestrates a proven hosting stack rather than building one. The
**data plane** is one or more Linux nodes running **Hestia Control Panel**, which
manages Nginx, Apache, PHP-FPM, MariaDB, BIND9, and Certbot. The Go control plane
drives it exclusively through the **provisioner**.

See [ADR 0001](adr/0001-hestia-as-provisioning-backend.md) for the "orchestrate,
don't fork" decision, and [`BACKEND.md`](BACKEND.md#8-provisioner) for the
provisioner package.

## 1. Components

| Component | Role on a node |
|---|---|
| **Hestia Control Panel** | Manages all of the below via its API/CLI; owns per-customer Linux users, quotas, and isolation. |
| **Nginx** | Front-end reverse proxy + static file serving; terminates HTTP(S). |
| **Apache HTTP Server** | Application server behind Nginx for PHP apps (`.htaccess` compatibility). |
| **PHP-FPM** | Runs PHP per site, with per-customer pools for isolation. |
| **MariaDB** | Customer databases and DB users. |
| **BIND9** | Installed with Hestia; **fallback only** — production DNS is Cloudflare ([ADR 0003](adr/0003-cloudflare-dns-and-ingress.md)). |
| **Certbot** | Let's Encrypt certificate issuance and renewal. |

> Nginx → Apache → PHP-FPM is the standard layered setup: Nginx handles TLS,
> static assets, and proxying; Apache + PHP-FPM run the dynamic PHP application.

## 2. How OpenCloud talks to Hestia

- The **provisioner** is the only component that touches a node. It uses Hestia's
  API (and CLI where the API is thin) over an authenticated, TLS channel. It is
  also the sole caller of the **Cloudflare API** for customer DNS zones/records
  ([ADR 0003](adr/0003-cloudflare-dns-and-ingress.md)).
- Every provisioner operation is **idempotent**: creating a site/DB/zone that
  already exists succeeds rather than errors. This makes job retries and drift
  reconciliation safe.
- No raw shell string interpolation — commands are built from typed, validated
  arguments. Customer-supplied values (domains, DB names) are validated before
  they reach a node. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
- Credentials for node access come from config (Viper) and are never logged.

```go
type Provisioner interface {
    CreateSite(ctx context.Context, node model.Node, spec SiteSpec) error
    DeleteSite(ctx context.Context, node model.Node, domain string) error
    CreateDatabase(ctx context.Context, node model.Node, spec DBSpec) error
    CreateDNSZone(ctx context.Context, node model.Node, zone string) error
    IssueCertificate(ctx context.Context, node model.Node, domain string) error
}
```

## 3. Node topology

```
                 OpenCloud control plane (Go API + worker)
                                │  provisioner (Hestia API/CLI, TLS)
        ┌───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┐
        ▼                       ▼                        ▼
   Hestia node 1           Hestia node 2            Hestia node N
   ─────────────          ─────────────            ─────────────
   Nginx / Apache         Nginx / Apache           Nginx / Apache
   PHP-FPM pools          PHP-FPM pools            PHP-FPM pools
   MariaDB                MariaDB                  MariaDB
   BIND9                  BIND9                    BIND9
   Certbot                Certbot                  Certbot
   Fail2ban + UFW         Fail2ban + UFW           Fail2ban + UFW
```

- Each node is registered in the `nodes` table with capacity/usage.
- New accounts are placed on the least-loaded online node (simple scheduler; see
  [`../ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) Phase 2/7).
- Nodes can be set to `draining` to stop new placements before maintenance.

## 4. Provisioning flows

All flows are **asynchronous** (queued via the `jobs` table, run by the worker) and update the
resource's `status`. The control plane reconciles its state with the node's.

### Create a site
```
1. service inserts sites row (status=provisioning) + enqueues provision_site
2. worker → provisioner.CreateSite:
     - create Hestia web domain (Nginx vhost + Apache + PHP-FPM pool)
     - set document root, PHP version
3. success → status=active ; failure → retry → status=failed + cleanup
```

### Add a domain + SSL
```
1. attach domain to site (DNS zone via the Cloudflare API — ADR 0003)
2. enqueue issue_certificate
3. provisioner.IssueCertificate (Certbot) → store cert metadata, status=active
4. renewal handled on the node by Certbot; control plane tracks expiry
```

### Provision a database
```
1. service inserts databases row (status=provisioning)
2. provisioner.CreateDatabase: MariaDB database + scoped DB user
3. credentials returned to the customer once, not stored in plaintext
```

### Suspend / delete
```
suspend: provisioner disables the web domain (503), keeps data → status=suspended
delete:  provisioner removes site/DB/zone, then control plane hard-deletes rows
```

## 5. Isolation on the node

Hestia provides OS-level multi-tenancy that complements application/DB scoping:

- **Separate Linux user per customer**, with home-directory permissions.
- **Per-customer PHP-FPM pools** so one site can't read another's processes/files.
- **Per-customer MariaDB users** scoped to their own databases.
- Resource quotas (disk, optionally CPU/memory) enforced per account.

This is the third isolation layer described in
[`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md#8-multi-tenancy--isolation).

## 6. SSL / certificates

- Issuance and renewal use **Certbot** (Let's Encrypt) on the node.
- The control plane records certificate domain, issuer, and expiry; renewal alerts
  fire before expiry (monitoring — [`INFRASTRUCTURE.md`](INFRASTRUCTURE.md)).
- HTTPS is enforced (HSTS) for customer sites and the dashboard.

## 7. DNS & ingress (Cloudflare — ADR 0003)

- Customer zones live in the platform's Cloudflare account. Customers **bring
  their own domain** and point it at the Cloudflare-assigned nameservers.
- Record changes go through the API (`/dns/zones/{id}/records`) → provisioner →
  **Cloudflare API**. Propagation status is surfaced in the UI.
- Inbound traffic (dashboard, API, customer sites) enters through **Cloudflare
  Tunnel** (`cloudflared`, outbound-only) — no static IP or open inbound ports
  required on our hardware. The tunnel carries HTTP(S) only: customer file
  access starts with the web file manager, not raw FTP/SFTP.
- BIND9 on the nodes is the documented **fallback** (self-hosted Hestia DNS
  cluster, `v-add-remote-dns-host`) if Cloudflare must ever be dropped — see
  [ADR 0003](adr/0003-cloudflare-dns-and-ingress.md).

## 8. Backups

- Hestia handles per-account backups on the node (web files, databases, mail).
- Backup schedules and retention are configured per node and documented in a
  runbook. Restores are rehearsed.
- Control-plane data (PostgreSQL) is backed up separately — see
  [`DATABASE.md`](DATABASE.md#9-backups).

## 9. Node hardening

Every node runs **Fail2ban** and **UFW** with only required ports open, plus the
standard hardening in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). Node bootstrap/hardening is
scripted under `deploy/hestia/` so a new node is reproducible.

## 10. Failure & reconciliation

- Because the provisioner is idempotent, failed jobs retry safely.
- A periodic **reconciliation job** compares control-plane state to each node's
  actual state and repairs drift (e.g. a site marked active but missing on the
  node), or flags it for an operator.
- Partial provisioning is cleaned up by compensating actions — no orphaned
  resources on a node or stale `active` rows in the DB.
