## Other folders

| Folder / file | Holds |
|---|---|
| `adr/` | Architecture Decision Records — one file per significant decision |
| `adr/0000-template.md` | Copy this to start a new ADR |
| `runbooks/` | Operational how-tos (incident response, restores). Added as procedures stabilize |

## Writing an ADR

1. Copy `adr/0000-template.md` to `adr/NNNN-short-title.md` (next number).
2. Fill it in — context, decision, consequences. Keep it short.
3. ADRs are **immutable** once `Accepted`. To change a decision, write a new ADR
   that supersedes the old one and mark the old one `Superseded`.

ADRs record *why*. If a reader (or Claude) asks "why is it built this way?", the
answer should be findable here.
