# Deployment

How OpenCloud is built, released, and rolled back. Packaging and environments are
in [`INFRASTRUCTURE.md`](INFRASTRUCTURE.md); this covers the release process.

**Stack:** Docker · Docker Compose · CI (build/lint/test) · Bun migrations.

---

## 1. Artifacts

| Artifact | Built from | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `opencloud-backend` image | `backend/Dockerfile` (multi-stage) | Go binary serving both `api` and `worker` (selected by command) |
| `opencloud-frontend` image | `Dockerfile` (repo root) | Next.js standalone build |

Images are immutable and tagged by version + git SHA (e.g.
`opencloud-backend:1.4.0-ab12cd3`). The same image promotes through staging → prod.

## 2. CI pipeline

Runs on every PR and on merge to `main`. **Merges are blocked unless CI is green.**

```
1. Backend:  gofmt check · golangci-lint · go test ./... · govulncheck · docker build
2. Frontend: oxlint · tsc --noEmit · npm run build · npm audit
3. On main:  build + push tagged images
```

See [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) for the test layers and [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
for the PR workflow.

## 3. Environments & promotion

```
feature branch → PR (CI) → merge to main → deploy staging → verify → promote to production
```

- **development** — local Docker Compose; fake provisioner.
- **staging** — mirrors production config against a test Hestia node; auto-deployed
  from `main`.
- **production** — promoted from a verified staging build; manual approval gate.

Config differs only by environment variables ([`INFRASTRUCTURE.md`](INFRASTRUCTURE.md#3-configuration--environment-variables)).

## 4. Database migrations

- Migrations run as an explicit deploy step, **before** the new app version starts:
  ```bash
  go run ./cmd/migrate up
  ```
- Production is **forward-only**; never edit a shipped migration — add a new one.
- Migrations must be **backward-compatible** with the currently-running app version
  so a deploy (or rollback) never breaks live traffic. The pattern for breaking
  schema changes is **expand → migrate → contract**:
  1. *Expand:* add new columns/tables; deploy app that writes both old + new.
  2. *Migrate:* backfill data.
  3. *Contract:* deploy app that uses only new; later migration drops the old.
- A failed migration aborts the deploy; the previous version keeps serving.

## 5. Deploy procedure (Compose)

```bash
git pull                              # or check out the release tag
docker compose pull                   # fetch new images (or build)
go run ./cmd/migrate up               # via a one-shot migrate container
docker compose up -d --no-deps api worker frontend
docker compose ps                     # verify health
curl -fsS localhost:8080/readyz       # readiness gate
```

- `api` and `worker` are stateless → replaceable without data loss.
- Roll services one at a time behind the proxy for zero-downtime where the
  orchestrator supports it.

## 6. Zero-downtime considerations

- **Stateless services** (API, worker, frontend) scale horizontally and roll
  without draining state — sessions/queues live in Redis.
- **Readiness gating:** new instances take traffic only after `/readyz` passes.
- **Graceful shutdown:** on `SIGTERM` the API drains in-flight HTTP and the worker
  finishes its current job before exiting ([`BACKEND.md`](BACKEND.md#3-entry-points)).
- **Backward-compatible migrations** (above) keep old and new app versions working
  against the same schema during a rollout.

## 7. Rollback

- **App:** redeploy the previous image tag. Because services are stateless and
  migrations are backward-compatible, this is safe and fast.
- **Schema:** prefer rolling *forward* with a fix. Only run a `down` migration if it
  is known-safe for current data; destructive `down`s are avoided in production.
- **Data:** restore from PostgreSQL backups only as a last resort, following the
  rehearsed restore runbook ([`DATABASE.md`](DATABASE.md#9-backups)).

## 8. Hosting node provisioning

- Hosting nodes are **not** part of the app deploy — they run Hestia on the host.
- A new node is bootstrapped with the scripts in `deploy/hestia/` (install Hestia,
  apply Fail2ban + UFW + hardening), then registered in the `nodes` table.
- Node OS and Hestia upgrades follow their own maintenance window, draining the
  node first ([`HOSTING.md`](HOSTING.md)).

## 9. Secrets & config at deploy time

- Production secrets come from the orchestrator's secret store, injected as env
  vars — never baked into images or committed.
- Changing a secret (e.g. rotating `JWT_SECRET`) is a deliberate, documented
  operation; rotating the JWT signing key invalidates active access tokens
  (clients refresh).

## 10. Post-deploy verification

After every production deploy:
1. `/healthz` and `/readyz` green on all instances.
2. Error rate and latency steady in Grafana ([`INFRASTRUCTURE.md`](INFRASTRUCTURE.md#5-monitoring-prometheus--grafana)).
3. A smoke test of a critical flow (login → list sites).
4. Queue depth draining normally; no failed-job spike.

If any check fails, roll back (§7) and investigate before re-attempting.

## 11. Release tagging & changelog

- Tag releases with SemVer (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
- Move `CHANGELOG.md`'s **[Unreleased]** section under the new version + date on
  release ([`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md)).
